### **Introduction**
An over-the-air (OTA) update is the wireless delivery of new software, firmware, or other data to mobile devices. Wireless carriers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) typically use over-the-air updates to deploy firmware and configure phones for use on their networks over Wi-Fi or mobile broadband. The initialization of a newly pur-chased phone, for example, requires an over-the-air update. With the rise of smartphones, tablets and internet of things (IoT) devices, carriers and manufacturers have turned to different over-the-air update architecture methods for deploying new operating systems (OSes) to these devices.
### **Goal of the Project**
Defining and implementation of an inter-cluster protocol where nodes verify the binary of other nodes by means of co-operative hash checking. Defining/Implementation of mechanism to receive/execute the updates.
### **References**
There are many reference implementations like RIOT secure OTA update that can be stud-ied/adapted.
### **Constraints**
The target design/implementation is for IoT devices that are communication within clus-ter of nodes which are using RTOSs and GPOS.

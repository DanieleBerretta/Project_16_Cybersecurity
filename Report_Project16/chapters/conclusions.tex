\chapter{Conclusions}
\begin{flushleft}
Over-The-Air Update Service is and will be more and more fundamental for the Software Update.
The protocol described in this report can be the starting point for other development.
Using this protocol you have an working OTA update usable with ESP32 Board, that is versatile for different application.

There would be others possible ideas to improve and specialize the protocol, making it perhaps more resilient to be used on different board, and not only on ESP32, but also perhaps introducing the possibility of using a proprietary server and certificate.
